# Diffware

The goal of this tool is to provide a summary of the changes between two files or directories. It can be extensively configured to keep only the changes that matter to you, and be combined with tools like [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) to dive into those differences.

## Installing

Python 3.8 or newer is recommended.

### Minimal

The minimal install doesn't allow for automatic file extraction, but can work on already extracted files and directories.

Install requirements available through pip:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

`fact_helper_file` provides [filemagick](https://pypi.org/project/python-magic/) with custom signatures and config parsing helpers:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/fact_helper_file.git
cd fact_helper_file
pip3 install .
```

All that is left is to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbus-seclab/diffware.git ~/diffware
cd ~/diffware
```

### Full

The full install adds an automatic extraction tool.

Install [fact_extractor](https://github.com/fkie-cad/fact_extractor):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/fact_extractor.git ~/fact_extractor
cd ~/fact_extractor
fact_extractor/install/pre_install.sh
fact_extractor/install.py
```

Make sure the pip requirements are installed:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbus-seclab/Diffware.git ~/diffware
cd ~/diffware
```

## Configuration

Most parameters can be set from the CLI and using the config file (see `config.cfg` for an example).

While settings in the `diff` section are specific to this tool, the ones in the `unpack` and `ExpertSettings` are shared with [fact_extractor](https://github.com/fkie-cad/fact_extractor), so you should check out their documentation.

Here's a list of options that can be set in the config file:

### `diff` section

## Optimizing

### Extracting

For faster analysis, you should try to avoid extracting files on every run by using the `--no-extract` option. Since the tool can work on directories, you can either manually extract the content beforehand, or run the script once and then run it again on the extracted folder.

### Specializing

Some types of files have specific comparing mechanisms to make the output more robust. As this can add significant overhead, they can be disabled using the `--no-specialize` option.

Disabling this option has the side effect of making the comparison tool follow symlinks. Though it shouldn't fail regardless of what the link points to, it may result in symlinks being reported as different and timeouts being shown while reading from them. In that case, you may want to ignore symlinks by using the `--exclude-mime inode/symlink` option.

### Ignoring files

You should also try to exclude as many files as possible, either based on their mime-type:

```
--exclude-mime "audio/*" --exclude-mime "image/*" --exclude-mime "video/*"
```

... or based on their path:

```
--exclude "*/build/*" --exclude "*.txt" --exclude "*.json"
```

You can also tweak the `blacklist` option from the config file to prevent unpacking attempts of known mime-types for which it's unnecessary.

### Saving time for moved detection

If folders have been renamed (apart from the root file), try renaming them so the overall hierarchy of both files match. Otherwise, many files will have to be compared to attempt to detect the ones that have been moved.

## Tools

### Diffoscope

The output of this script can be parsed to run [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) on the identified changes:

```bash
./tools/diffoscope.py path-to-output-diff
```

Any option other than the path to the file will be passed to `diffoscope`. When possible, the modified files won't be copied, but a hardlink will be created in a temporary folder.

## Examples

### OpenWRT

Let's say we want to find out what changes have been made between two firmware versions, to know if some features have been added or some vulnerabilities have been patched. In this example, we'll work with two releases of [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/). Though the source code is [publicly available](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt), it serves as a useful illustration of how this tool can be used.

Here's the result of comparing the `rootfs-squashfs.img.gz` of versions [19.07.2](https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/19.07.2/targets/x86/64/) and [19.07.3](https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/19.07.3/targets/x86/64/) for the x86-64 architecture:

```bash
$ ./main.py ~/openwrt-19.07.2-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs.img.gz ~/openwrt-19.07.3-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs.img.gz --output /dev/null
[WARNING] Found 2250 files with different paths (and 0 with similar paths), looking for moved files may take a while. Did a folder name change?                                               
```

As you can see, the files have been decompressed and the squashfs filesystem read automatically by [fact_extractor](https://github.com/fkie-cad/fact_extractor). The extracted files should be available in `/tmp/extractor1/files` and `/tmp/extractor2/files`. However, a warning shows that no files with similar paths have been found.

This is because the folder extracted from the archive contains the version number. Thankfully, this is easy to fix. Let's just run the script again on the extracted subfolders, which have the same hierachy:

```bash
$ mv /tmp/extractor1/files/openwrt-19.07.2-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs.img_extracted ~/openwrt-19.07.2-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs
$ mv /tmp/extractor2/files/openwrt-19.07.3-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs.img_extracted ~/openwrt-19.07.3-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs
$ ./main.py ~/openwrt-19.07.2-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs ~/openwrt-19.07.3-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs --no-extract
Found 9 added files, 0 removed files and 267 changed files (276 files in total)
```

Much better! When looking at the output, we notice quite a few images, which we'd like to exclude. We can run the script again:

```bash
$ ./main.py ~/openwrt-19.07.2-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs ~/openwrt-19.07.3-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs --no-extract --exclude-mime "image/*"
Found 10 added files, 0 removed files and 241 changed files (251 files in total)
```

Once again, better. There are some changes related to package versions, we can also decide to exclude them:

```bash
$ ./main.py ~/openwrt-19.07.2-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs ~/openwrt-19.07.3-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs --no-extract --exclude-mime "image/*" --exclude "*.control"
Found 10 added files, 0 removed files and 134 changed files (144 files in total)
```

Now that we're happy with the output, we can save it to a file and run [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) to dive into the changes:

```bash
$ ./main.py ~/openwrt-19.07.2-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs ~/openwrt-19.07.3-x86-64-rootfs-squashfs --no-extract --exclude-mime "image/*" --exclude "*.control" --output ~/openwrt-19.07.2_vs_19.07.3.diff
$ ./tools/diffoscope.py ~/openwrt-19.07.2_vs_19.07.3.diff --html-dir ~/openwrt-diff --exclude-command "^stat .*"
```

**Note:** The `--exclude-command` option of diffoscope is not mandatory, but it makes the output less noisy. `--diff-mask` can also prove quite useful to ignore versions strings or dates for example.


In the end, we have obtained:
* A list of files containing only the differences that matter to our use-case,
* A quicker look at their content by running diffoscope on this script's output,
* A set of options that can be turned into a config file and later reused for other versions of OpenWRT so this work doesn't have to be done each time.

### FRRouting

A use case example can be found in [the doc folder](doc/blogpost.md). It shows how to use both this tool and [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) to identify a vulnerability fix in an upgrade.
